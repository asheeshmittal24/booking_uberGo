Project Description
Booking Uber-Go is a dynamic cab booking Project where different users can book their nearest cab and the current location of the cab is updated as it traverses each location in its path using threading.Each request is pushed as thread so that changes in the cab location is updated and shown when another request is made.Nearest cab is allocated to the user using shortest path given by Dijkstra Algorithm and then along with the path from source to destination, cost of the route is specified to the user.

Data Structures Used:
Graph
Priority Queue
Map
Stack
Structure
String
Array
Vector

Main Algorithm Used:
Dijkstra Algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path between the locations in a graph.

Computer Science Fundamentals Used:
Threading. This concept makes multi-request possible by ensuring parallelism to each request.

Limitation:
This project does not allow users to book sharing-cab.It is assumed that the capacity of each cab is one person.
